 D+ Browser TODO List
----------------------

Short-term goals for the initial D+ Browser release.
Basically this will be Dillo-Win32 the way I would have done it
if I hadn't wasted so much time trying to cooperate with mainline.

General:
[X] Merge patches from Dillo-Win32
[ ] Rebrand the browser as D+ (DPlus?)
[ ] Use config.h rather than -DENABLE_* in CPPFLAGS

Documentation:
[X] README
[ ] BUILDING/INSTALL
[ ] AUTHORS
[ ] ChangeLog
[ ] HACKING and developer documentation

Network:
[ ] Remove all remaining DPI code
[X] Make DlGui a standard feature
[ ] Clean up the HTTPS code
[ ] Move directory list generation from file.c into a separate module

Preferences:
[ ] Add portable application support on Windows (save prefs to current dir)
[ ] Save preferences in prefs.c, not PrefsGui
[ ] Initialize default search list in prefs.c

User interface:
[X] Normalize keyboard shortcuts
[ ] Find a better UI font
[ ] Right-click menu for input boxes
[X] Switch to a Firefox-style search bar
[ ] Use the arrow cursor over the status bar
[ ] Add zoom controls in the status bar
[ ] Add a "new tab" button to the tab bar
[ ] Show the tab bar when only one tab is open
[X] Fix keyboard navigation in the bookmarks menu
[ ] Allow changing the stored URL for bookmarks
[ ] Switch to a more conventional menu/toolbar layout

Packaging:
[ ] Create a script to package release tarballs
[ ] Integrate packaging (Windows, DOS, Linux) into the build system
