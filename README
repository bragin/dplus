 D+ Browser
------------

DPlus is a graphical web browser with an emphasis on security, performance,
and portability.

It is based on Dillo (http://www.dillo.org/); the name "D+" reflects the
developer's opinion of the Dillo Project's code quality and organization.

DPlus currently supports Windows, DOS, OS X, and Unix systems.

1. Current Plans
----------------

DPlus continues where Dillo-Win32 (http://dillo-win32.sourceforge.net/)
left off.  The initial release will essentially be "Dillo-Win32 improved,"
with a cleaner user interface, greater portability, and less legacy code
than was possible when we were attempting to maintain upstream compatibility.

At the moment there are no plans for long-term development.
I (Benjamin Johnson) am releasing DPlus because I personally find it useful,
and I think others might find it useful as well; however, I have neither the
time nor the interest to make this anything more than a one-off release.

PLEASE NOTE: I do NOT provide technical support for DPlus; chances are I
will delete such emails unanswered and unread.
